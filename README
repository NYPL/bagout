# Bagout

Bagout is a set of scripts to download folders from popular cloud services into the BagIt structure. It uses checksums and file sizes generated by the cloud service and available through their API to complete the bag manifest and 0xum, instead of generating these locally.

Currently supported cloud storage services:
* AWS S3
* Google Drive
